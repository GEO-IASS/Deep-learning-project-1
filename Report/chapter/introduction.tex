This report is a description of the project conducted as part of the mandatory work in the course Deep Learning at Aarhus University Department of Engineering.

In the project, a convolutional neural network will be constructed with the purpose of training and testing on the CIFAR-10 data set. One network architecture is used, but different hyperparameters will be presented as to show how tweaking these can drastically alter the results of the convolutional neural networks performance. 

The theory behind the project will be presented as well. This theory is part of the curriculum of the course, and gives the necessary knowledge to understand the developed neural network. 

The project is developed in Python 3.5 in a Tensorflow environment. Tensorboard is used for visualizing results.
