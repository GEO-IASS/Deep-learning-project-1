This report is a description of the project conducted as part of the mandatory work in the course \emph{Deep Learning} at Aarhus University Department of Engineering.

In the project, a convolutional neural network will be constructed with the purpose of training and testing on the CIFAR-10 data set. Two network architecture are used and different hyperparameters will be evaluated as to show how tweaking these can drastically alter the results of the convolutional neural network's performance. 

The theory behind the project will be presented as well. This theory is part of the curriculum of the course, and gives the necessary knowledge to understand the developed neural network. 

The project is developed in Python 3.5 using the Tensorflow framework. Tensorboard is used for visualizing the results.
